Appearance: Upon entering the smoked filled bar, the scent of tobacco and alcohol fills your nose.   The sound of various people speaking through their inebriation throughout the bar fills the quiet.

The neck beneath the wolf like maw showed a patch of white fur that lead down into his black shirt.
